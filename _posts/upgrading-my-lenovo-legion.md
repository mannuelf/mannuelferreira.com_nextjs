Right ok, so I spilled water on on my keyboard on my favourite laptop and rendered it useless. I had to buy a new keyboard and replace it. 

Why would you do that especially after watching this scary [YouTube](https://youtu.be/x3djdGr2yM4) video. Take it to a guy "they" said. I kinda dig computer and I think its fun, and it was great fun, well not the soldering part that was torture.

## What you will need

1. Patience
2. [Replacement keyboard](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000901894543.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.0.0.21ef1802c1Rdl1) from AliExpress the [Azazel Store](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000901894543.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.0.0.21ef1802c1Rdl1) to be precise.
3. Magnetised Phillips Screw driver and credit card (to pry open the laptop once the screws have been free'd).
4. Soldering iron (inexpensive hobby ones are fine) you only need it to melt plastic rivets (mor on this later)
5. Patience, did I say that already.

### The dismantle
