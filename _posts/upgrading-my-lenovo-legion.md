Right ok, so I spilled water on on my keyboard on my favourite laptop and rendered it useless. I had to buy a new keyboard and replace it.

Why would you do that especially after watching this scary [YouTube](https://youtu.be/x3djdGr2yM4) video. Take it to a guy "they" said. I kinda dig computer and I think its fun, and it was great fun, well not the soldering part that was torture.

## What you will need

1. Patience
2. [Replacement keyboard](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000901894543.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.0.0.21ef1802c1Rdl1) from AliExpress the [Azazel Store](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000901894543.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.0.0.21ef1802c1Rdl1) to be precise.
3. Magnetised Phillips Screw driver and credit card (to pry open the laptop once the screws have been free'd).
4. Soldering iron (inexpensive hobby ones are fine) you only need it to melt plastic rivets (mor on this later)
5. Patience, did I say that already.

## The dismantle

### New Keybaord

Feeling pretty pleased with myself at this point, only paid $28 for this repalacement keyboard.

Looks very close to the real thing.

### MAC Memory 16BG's

Oh yes, bumping RAM up to 16GB's

### Soldering iron

The only non-destructive way to detatch the keyboard from the plastic Lenovo chasey is by melting tiny little rivets off one at a time.

### Before, dusty fans needed a clean

Throughout the process I took pictures and labeled screws, do this, or bad things may happen later.

### That has to go in there

At this point I was questing my lifes choices.

### Motherboard off

### Screen detatched

See that black wrapping, and silver chassis, well the keyboard is under that, protected by many plastic rivets.

These tiny black dots are the rivets that neeed melting off, this was the most time consuming task of all.

### Tadaaa, keyboard off

### Goodbye old friend

> All those must be put back together again

> Careful don't touch anything

![lenovo-legion-keyboard-replacement](/assets/blog/upgrading-my-lenovo-legion/legion-13.jpg)
> Nearing the end...

### End scene, everything back together again

This process took 5hrs, spread out over 2 sessions of 2.5hrs, If I werer to do it again I am sure it would be much faster and easier.

Thanks for scrolling, see you next time.
