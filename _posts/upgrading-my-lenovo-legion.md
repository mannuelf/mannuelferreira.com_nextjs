Right ok, so I spilled water on on my keyboard on my favourite laptop and rendered it useless. I had to buy a new keyboard and replace it. Why would you do that especially after watching this scary [YouTube](https://youtu.be/x3djdGr2yM4) video. FUN! it was great fun. 

## What you will need

1. Patience
2. [Replacement keyboard](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000901894543.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.0.0.21ef1802c1Rdl1) from AliExpress the [Azazel Store](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000901894543.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.0.0.21ef1802c1Rdl1) to be precise.
3. Magnetised Phillips Screw driver and credit card (to pry open the laptop once the screws have been free'd).
4.
