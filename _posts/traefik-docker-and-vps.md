I have an amazing website here [www.themwebs.me](https://www.themwebs.me) it's fast simple and cheaply hosted on a VPS with [www.hostinger.com](https://hostinger.com?REFERRALCODE=1MANNUELFER05).

I wanted a cheap hobby space where I could play with server technology like Traefik and docker. 

I needed a place to host backend APIs that I might create like this [one](https://factbookapi.themwebs.me/gross-gd) made with with python using Flask.

Now if playing with servers is not your jam, stop reading and head over to your favourite backend as service or servless providers.

Let's go.
