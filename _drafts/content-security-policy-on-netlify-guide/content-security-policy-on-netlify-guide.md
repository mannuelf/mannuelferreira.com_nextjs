## Security Response HTTP Headers

A developers job is never done ðŸ™‚ .

After deploying your website to Netlify (any server) naturally you will run some performance tests using [WebPageSpeedTest](https://www.webpagetest.org/). You might notice and alarming red `F` or `E` in the top right of the screen. What the heck is that?

## TLDR

![WebPageSpeedTest](/public/assets/blog/content-security-policy-on-netlify-guide/webpagespeedtest_0001.png)

This is a security score linked to a `CSP` (Content Security Policy), it shows whether any security policies are configured and to what degree. The CSP provides directives to configure what scripts are allowed to run or take an action in your webpage.

Setting the correct directives prevent clickjacking, cross-site scripting and illegal embedding of your webpage in an offsite frame/iframe.

Create a `netlify.toml` file and place this script within, deploy and test one more time.

### netlify.toml

```bash
[[headers]]
  for = "/*"
  [headers.values]
    X-Frame-Options = "SAMEORIGIN"
    X-XSS-Protection = "1; mode=block"
    X-Content-Type-Options = "nosniff"
    Content-Security-Policy = "default-src 'self'; frame-ancestors 'self'; form-action 'self'"
```

Once the Policy has been set with the above configuration, upload it and test it by opening the browser dev tools. Looking at the `console` , you will notice some errors that you have never seen before because you had no CSP configured. In my case on Netlify deploy preview-mode I saw:

```bash
60d2b0fc45694e0008dd4d32--mannuelferreira.netlify.app/:1 Refused to load the script 'https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/bundles/1bd814911a09d5e56b421403a658cbae5d2685ce.js' because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "script-src 'self'". Note that 'script-src-elem' was not explicitly set, so 'script-src' is used as a fallback.
```

My CSP is preventing `cloudfront.net` above from executing in my webpage.

GREAT ðŸš€

I trust Netlify and it's domains, so I should whitelist it by adding the domain and sub-domains to the `default-src` directive e.g.

```bash
Content-Security-Policy = "default-src 'self' cloudfront.net *.cloudfront.net; frame-ancestors 'self'; form-action 'self'"
```

Bare in mind this list has the potential to get lengthy the more scripts you plan to allow execution, you can see how mine has grown here: [netlify.toml](https://github.com/mannuelf/mannuelferreira.com_nextjs/blob/main/netlify.toml#L15)

### Rerun the test

`Test result`

![WebPageSpeedTest](/public/assets/blog/content-security-policy-on-netlify-guide/webpagespeedtest_success.png)

Not using Netlify? try one of these:

### Nginx

```bash
server {
  ...
  add_header "X-Frame-Options" "SAMEORIGIN";
  add_header "X-XSS-Protection" "1; mode=block";
  add_header "X-Content-Type-Options" "nosniff";
  add_header "Content-Security-Policy" "default-src 'self'; frame-ancestors 'self'; form-action 'self'";
  ...
}
```

### Apache

```bash
<IfModule mod_headers.c>
  Header set X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN"
  Header set X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block"
  Header set X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff"
  Header set Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'; frame-ancestors 'self'; form-action 'self'"
</IfModule>
```

### IIS

```bash
<system.webServer>
  <httpProtocol>
    <customHeaders>
      <add name="X-Frame-Options" value="SAMEORIGIN" />
      <add name="X-XSS-Protection" value="1; mode=block" />
      <add name="X-Content-Type-Options" value="nosniff" />
      <add name="Content-Security-Policy" value="default-src 'self'; frame-ancestors 'self'; form-action 'self'" />
    </customHeaders>
  </httpProtocol>
</system.webServer>
```

## CSP Content Security Policy

CSP stands for Content Security Policy

> **DO NOT** use X-Content-Security-Policy or X-WebKit-CSP. Their implementations are obsolete (since Firefox 23, Chrome 25), limited, inconsistent, and incredibly buggy. [Read more here](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Content_Security_Policy_Cheat_Sheet.html#http-headers)

### Let's break it down

By adding those configurations to your server you are essentially creating a security policy.

A policy that tells the browser what to do with a request, allow it or block it based on what you've configured. Note the absence of this configuration will render your server in-secure.

(in order or appearance):

- `X-Frame-Options` prevents **click jacking** by not allowing your webpage to be loaded in a frame or iframe. The SAMEORIGIN property allows a page to be loaded in a frame on the same origin as the page itself only.
- `X-XSS-Protection` blocks any request that is deemed to be [Cross Site Scripting Attack](#CrossSiteScriptingAttack).
- `X-Content-Type-Options` protects against MIME type confusion attacks, ensures to load a resource only if the correct MIME type of is a matched against what is expected.
- `Content-Security-Policy` allows you to set a custom policy on what scripts, urls, images, fonts and resources are allowed to execute in your webpage. Any resource that is not whitelisted will not be allowed to execute.
