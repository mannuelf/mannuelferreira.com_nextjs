## Pattern type

This is a behavioural pattern, it allows algorithms to be selected on-the-fly at runtime

## Intent

This pattern allows the client to choose from a family of algorithms and gives a simple way to switch between the different algorithms.

## Problem

You may have a class that has a method that performs a specific task, but you want to be able to change the way the task is performed without changing the class.

As an example imagine you have a class that has a method that calculates the total cost of a shopping cart.
You may want to be able to change the way the total is calculated, for example, you may want to calculate the total with or without tax.

    class ShoppingCart {
        +calculateTotal()
        +calulateShipping()
    }

    class ShoppingCartWithTax {
        +calculateTotal()
    }

    class ShoppingCartWithoutTax {
        +calculateTotal()
    }

    ShoppingCart <|-- ShoppingCartWithTax
    ShoppingCart <|-- ShoppingCartWithoutTax
```
