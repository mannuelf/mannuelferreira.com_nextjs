## Pattern type

This is a behavioural pattern, it allows algorithms to be selected on-the-fly at runtime

## Intent

This pattern allows the client to choose from a family of algorithms and gives a simple way to switch between the different algorithms.

## Problem

You may have a class that has a method that performs a specific task, but you want to be able to change the way the task is performed without changing the class.

As an example imagine you have a class that has a method that calculates the total cost of a shopping cart.
You may want to be able to change the way the total is calculated, for example, you may want to calculate the total with or without tax.

## Pattern

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class ShoppingCart {
        +calculateTotal()
        +calulateShipping()
    }

    class ShoppingCartWithTax {
        +calculateTotal()
    }

    class ShoppingCartWithoutTax {
        +calculateTotal()
    }

    ShoppingCart <|-- ShoppingCartWithTax
    ShoppingCart <|-- ShoppingCartWithoutTax

class Item {
    +price
}
```

## Code example

```python
class ShoppingCart:
    def __init__(self, items):
        self.items = items

    def calculate_total(self):
        raise NotImplementedError()
```

```python
class Item:
    def __init__(self, price):
        self.price = price
```

```python
class ShoppingCartWithTax(ShoppingCart):
    def calculate_total(self):
        total = sum(item.price for item in self.items)
        return total * 1.2

class ShoppingCartWithoutTax(ShoppingCart):
    def calculate_total(self):
        return sum(item.price for item in self.items)
```

```python
cart = ShoppingCartWithTax([Item(10), Item(20)])
print(f"total cart with tax {cart.calculate_total()}")

cart_without_tax = ShoppingCartWithoutTax([Item(10), Item(20)])
print(f"total cart without tax {cart_without_tax.calculate_total()}")
```

prints out:

```text
total cart with tax: 36.0
total cart with out tax: 30
```
